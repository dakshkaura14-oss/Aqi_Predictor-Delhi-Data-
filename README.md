# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Machine Learning

### This project analyzes real-world air pollution data and builds a predictive model to estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on major pollutants. Using Linear Regression, the system predicts AQI from PM2.5, PM10, and CO concentrations. The project also includes data visualization to understand the correlation between pollutants and atmospheric air quality. A Streamlit-based web app enables users to input current pollutant levels and view the forecasted AQI instantly.


## Features
